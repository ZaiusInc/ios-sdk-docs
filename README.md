# Getting Started

Visit **Account Settings** -&gt; **Apps & Data** -&gt; **Mobile Apps** and create a mobile app that you will refer to in your integration and when sending campaigns. 

{% hint style="info" %}
Each app needs a name and identifier.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
Apps are cross platform, meaning if you have an app that is available on both iOS and Android you should create a single app to represent them within Zaius.
{% endhint %}

Once you've created the app you need to upload the appropriate certificate and/or API keys so that we may send to your users.
